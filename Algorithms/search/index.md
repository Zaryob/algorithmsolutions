Searching Algorithms
========
Search is **an operation that used to "find elements of array comparing with a value using some techiques"**. Searching is used to check given value and find compatible with it or retrieve any element, from any type of data structures.

There are some algorithms for searching.  Searching algorithms grouped into two. First one is **Sequencial Searching Algorithms**. Main reach of this type of algorithms are checking all values and find compatible one. Second one is **Interval Based Sarching Algorithms**. This tecnique used with sorted arrays. We target the center of the array then, we divide array into parts. We check each parts start and end, then we recognize which subarray can contain that value and we divide available part to two again, until find exact value.

They can be listed as:
 * Linear Search
 * Binary Search
 * Deep First Search
 * Cross Seach (Breadth First Search)
