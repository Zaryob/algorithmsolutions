Algorithms
===================

Firstly I'm gonna represent `algorithms`. Because this silly computers everytime works how we code them up. They cannot optimize any of codes(I'm not mentioning about compilers). If you coded a sorting with long way for example topological sort or bubble sort, it cannot work as fast as merge sort etc.

An algorithm for a particular task can be defined as **`a finite sequence of instructions, eachof which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finitelength of time`**. So, firstly we need to generally need a program that is written in a rigorous formal language. Because of computer's inflexibility compared to the human mind, programs usually need to contain more details. We will say this details as algorithms.

Each algorithm is a representation and implementation of tasks. We need to approach each task step by step giving commands. Every algorithm is detaily generated programming steps. In deed we are using some mathematical techiques for programming them. We use some basic algorithm methods while doing these operations in computer programs. These methods differ in terms of usage, performance and complexity. 

For instance, **Imparative Programming** describes the calculation intervals of commands that change the program state; here **Statement Based Programming** or **Declarative Programming** specifies what the program must achieve without explaining how to do it. These notes will primarily be concerned with developing algorithms that easily match the compulsory programming approach.

Algorithms are `pseudo` codes. They are represented in formal language and some mathematical expressions. Then we use this tecniques to create programs or libraries. 

Most algorithms are designed to be implemented as computers. However, it is also applied in other methods, such as the biological neural network (eg the human brain calculates or an insect searches for food), electrical circuitry or mechanical devices.
