There are many ways to write content in Jupyter Book. This short section
covers a few tips for how to do so.

These notes will cover the basic data structures and algorithms used in computer science and will bring together a wide range of topics covered elsewhere in a coherent framework. Data structures will be formulated to represent various types of information so that they can be manipulated appropriately and efficiently by the algorithms we have developed. In general, recurring practical issues such as algorithm specification, validation, and performance analysis will be discussed. We will start by looking at some of the common basic data structures (i.e. arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues) and their associated abstract data disadvantages and disadvantages. Next, we will consider the ubiquitous search problem and how this leads to general ideas of computational efficiency and complexity.

In the last part, we will combine compatative programming with all these techniques with programming skills.
